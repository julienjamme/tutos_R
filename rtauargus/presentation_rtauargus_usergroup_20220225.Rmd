# Motivation

# Context

- Need to protect complex sets of tables:
  - from business surveys
  - multiple linked tables
  - non-nested hierarchical variables
  - multiple response variables 
  - use of **suppressive methods**

--

- $\tau$-Argus: required tool to apply SDC method on data
  - efficient and reliable tool
  - without reliable competitor
  - graphical interface

--

- Need to build a complete workflow using a statistical software
  - to automate the treatments
  - to make a reproducible work
  - to keep records of our treatments

---
# Context

- Insee used to using `SAS`:
  - development of a SAS macro interfacing SAS with $\tau$-Argus: `SASTauArgus`
  - available on github https://github.com/InseeFrLab/SASTauArgus
  - proven and well tested
  - `r emo::ji("danger")` documentation only in French.

-- 

- Recently, our choice is to use `R`

---

# Context 

- Firstly, we tested `sdcTable`:
  - a package full of promises
  - but it doesn't match all of our needs
  
=> need to develop and use our own package
